## Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. The configuration is included in the project.

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript
- Provide proper type definitions
- Export types for public APIs

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain high test coverage (>80%)
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Make your changes**
- Write code following the existing patterns
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed

3. **Test your changes**
```bash
pnpm run test:coverage
pnpm run build
```

4. **Commit your changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

Use conventional commit messages:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `test:` for test additions/changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring

5. **Push and create PR**
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### PR Requirements

- All tests must pass
- Code coverage must be maintained
- Documentation must be updated
- Examples must work correctly

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions and methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Cover edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Tests

- Test the plugin in real Vite builds
- Test with various image formats
- Test HTML transformation

### Coverage Requirements

Maintain at least 80% coverage for:

- Statements

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Document complex algorithms
- Provide usage examples

### README Updates

Update the README when:
- Adding new features
- Changing configuration options
- Adding new examples

## Release Process

Releases are handled by maintainers:

1. Update version in package.json
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create release tag
4. Publish to npm

## Getting Help

- Open an issue for bugs or feature requests
- Start a discussion for questions
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
